    <h4> What is Node.js?</h4>
    <pre>
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
that allows developers to build server-side and networking applications 
using JavaScript. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which 
compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code for high performance.
 Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it 
lightweight and efficient, especially for data-intensive real-time applications.

<h4>Key Features of Node.js</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Asynchronous and Event-Driven: Node.js operates on a non-blocking I/O model, meaning it can handle multiple requests simultaneously without waiting for tasks to complete.</li>
    <li>Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable: Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop architecture, but it can handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.</li>
    <li>Fast Execution: Powered by the V8 engine, Node.js executes JavaScript code at lightning speed.
    </li>
    <li>Cross-Platform: Node.js runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other platforms.</li>
    <li> NPM (Node Package Manager): NPM is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries, making it easy to integrate third-party tools and modules into your application.
        </li>
</ol>
