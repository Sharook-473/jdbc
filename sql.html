    <h4>What is SQL?</h4>
    <pre>
 
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language
used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows
you to perform tasks such as querying data, inserting records, 
updating records, deleting records, and managing database structures.
SQL is essential for working with relational database management 
systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and 
SQLite.
