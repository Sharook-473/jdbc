    <h4>  What is Django?</h4>
  <pre>
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages
rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is desi-
gned to help developers take applications from concept to 
completion as quickly as possible. Django is free, open-
source, and follows the "batteries-included" philosophy,
meaning it comes with many built-in features for common 
web development tasks.
