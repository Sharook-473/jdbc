    <h4>What is Spring?</h4>
    <pre>
    
Spring is a powerful, open-source Java framework used for building
enterprise-level applications. It provides comprehensive infrast-
ructure support for developing robust, scalable, and maintainable 
Java applications. Spring simplifies Java development by offering 
a modular approach, allowing developers to use only the components 
they need. It is widely used for building web applications, micro-
services, REST APIs, and more.
