    <h5>Frameworks</h5>
    <p>A framework is a pre-built structure or set of tools that provides a foundation for developing software applications. It simplifies the development process by offering reusable code, libraries, and best practices, allowing developers to focus on building unique features rather than reinventing the wheel. Frameworks are widely used in web development, mobile development, and other areas of software engineering.</p>
   <h4> Advantages of Using Frameworks</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Faster Development: Pre-built components and libraries speed up development.</li>
        <li>Best Practices: Frameworks enforce coding standards and design patterns.</li>
        <li> Scalability: Designed to handle growth and increased complexity.</li>
        <li>Community Support: Large communities provide resources, tutorials, and plugins.</li>
        <li> Security: Built-in features help protect against common vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ol>
