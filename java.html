    <h4>Introduction to Java</h4>
    <pre>
        Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language
        known for its platform independence, reliability, and sca-
        lability. It follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA)
        principle, meaning Java programs can run on any platform 
        with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is widely used in
        web development, mobile applications (Android), enterprise
        software, and game development.

    </ol>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <pre>
        Java is a powerful and widely used programming language 
        with applications in various fields. Its platform indepe-
