    <h4>What is MongoDB?</h4>
    <pre>
    
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides high performance,
high availability, and easy scalability. Unlike traditional relat-
ional databases (SQL), MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like 
documents, making it ideal for handling unstructured or semi-stru
ctured data. It is widely used in modern web applications, big 
data, and real-time analytics.

<h4>Key Features of MongoDB</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Document-Oriented: Stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which is flexible and schema-less.</li>
    <li>Scalability: Supports horizontal scaling through sharding.</li>
    <li>High Performance: Optimized for read/write operations with in-memory computing.</li>
    <li>Rich Query Language: Supports CRUD operations, indexing, and aggregation.</li>
    <li>Replication: Provides high availability with automatic failover using replica sets.</li>
</ul>
